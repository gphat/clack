# Clack

Clack might be a charting library. It's really just a side project that may or may not turn in to anything.

## Goals

### Flexible

Clack will stay out of your way. Most changes will require working directly with the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas).

### Dynamic updates

Data should be able to be added to a chart on the fly and rerendered.

### Fast

Needs to be able to deal with thousands of series each with tens of thousands of points.

### Don't Give A Shit About File Size

Not at all. Bring on the deps.
